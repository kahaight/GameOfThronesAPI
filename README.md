<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the Game of Thrones database up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need a copy of Visual Studio 2019. Follow the link below should you do not have the free software installed already.
* Visual Studio 2019
```sh
Download Link: [MS Visual Studio Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
```

### GoT API
 
1. Clone the API
```sh
[Clone the API for Visual Studios Here](https://github.com/kahaight/GameOfThronesAPI)
```
2. Be sure to restore the NuGet Packages for the GoTAPI solution
```sh
Right click on Solution 'GoTAPI' and click on "restore NuGet Packages" and then bring in using statements needed.
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
This API is meant to be used as a resource that cross-cordinates Houses, Characters, Affilitions, and Episodes in various ways to help broaden an understanding of HBO's hit series Game of Thrones.
Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

When researching we can get a list, in this case of characters, with Id numbers as seen below. Let's note Tyrion's Id.

Then by adding a forward slash and the Id number of Tyrion we can bring up Tyrion's corresponding detail page.

[![Tyrion detail Page 1][screenshot-2]]


These details pages are fairly extensive as we combine 4 independent classes using 3 joining tables to present a character's; Id, Name, wheter they are alive, their episode of death, House, Gender, Actor, Cause of Death, Episodes, and Affiliations.
