<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Game of Thrones API][C:\Users\jack\OneDrive\Pictures]](https://github.com/kahaight/GameOfThronesAPI)

Here's a blank template to get started:
**To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`jackmccoy34`, `GameOfThronesAPI`, `twitter_handle`, `jackmccoy34@gmail.com`

We've created an API Web Application related to the fantasy world portrayed in the "Game of Thrones" telivision series.
The intended use for our project is to have the ability to retreive specific Game of Thrones information from a user's request. 
The client will send a request specifying which endpoint to be used. The API then takes this request to the server. 
From the server, a response containing the desired data is returned. The data is then converted into a readable response and 
will be displayed on the user's interface. This API can be used by anyone with a need for specified Game of Thrones
information, who would like to shorten their research time.  

### Built With
